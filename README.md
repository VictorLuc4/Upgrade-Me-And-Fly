## Flying company supported 

I don't do much OSINT so I did this program only with my last boarding pass. That is why I only got informations on Luftansa yet.  

Feel free to add more company codes in `codes.yaml`

#### Actually supported

- Luftansa

## Todo 

- Secure the code
- Add more companies
- Allow users to just change their information such as seat number, name etc by themselves.
